Attempts at getting WV_CPRS_V27 (OR_3_243V27) up and compiling in Delphi Dev Studio 2006

June, 2010

Copied source to:
p:\vista\CPRS-WV_OFFICIAL_RELEASE-27

Menu: Component\Install Packages --> Add ...
  Browse to Packages folder
  Don't add the file names that have *60.bpl 
	Don't add VA10.bpl
	Don't add Borland.bpl
  Add:
	Borland2006.bpl
	ORCtrlLib2006.bpl	
	ORDateLib2006.bpl
	VA508Access2006
	VA2006.bpl
	VAShared2006
	XWB_D10.bpl

Then found:  .\VA\VAShared2006.dpk
I suspect this is a combination of needed files. It opens, but I can't find how to install it.

So I closed this.

Opened up CPRSChart.dpr
Attempted compile.
Got error of missing ORSystem.dcu

Open project options.
Go to Directories and Conditionals
  Change the Unit Output Directory to the DCU folder.
  Change the Search Path so that is searches in:
    CPRS folder
    CPRSLib folder
    WVEHR-Lib folder
  Change the Packages output folder to 

Compile attempt again.  This time is is missing TRPCB.dcu
  In my other instances of compiling CPRS, I have always had the BDK32 folder in with the CPRS source. This is the RPC Broker.  It does not appear to be included anywhere in the source tree.
  A file search shows that it is in the DCU folder.  So back to the Options and include the DCU folder in the search path.

Compile attempt again.  Compiles much further.  Now error of multiple missing *.dfm files.  
  First missing one is. fDebugInfo.DFM.  A filesystem search doesn't find it.  
  A search for *.dfm reveals many files, but not the ones I need.
  Looking closer, the missing .dfm files are all related to the debugger.
  So I think this is a problem of the compiler wanting to recompile the TRPCB.dcu.

  So I am going to take a chance and copy over the BDK32 directory into the source tree and add it to the search path and see if that works.  I put it at the same level as the CPRS-Lib, VA, DCU etc folders.  I deleted the \BDK32\D7 folder.  Added \BDK32\Source to search path.

Compile attempt again..

Success!!
